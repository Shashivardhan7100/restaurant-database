# restaurant-database management system

Created an online web application for users to place restaurant orders.
 Users can add/remove items from their carts.
 Built with HTML, CSS, and PHP and saved all user information in a database with MYSQL. 
 Users, Admin, and Delivery agents have separate Web and login pages.
 Users can view prior order history and book a table in a restaurant.
 Admin can Add/Remove Delivery Agents by granting or denying access to their Web Pages.
